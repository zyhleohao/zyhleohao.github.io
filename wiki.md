Following a calamity, **GIS** is instrumental in the assessment of the extent of damage and design of the recovery programs. Spatial comparison between pre- and post-disaster imagery helps to quantify effects on different sectors such as infrastructure, housing, and natural resources which in turn inform resource distribution about where efforts should be focused to guide reconstruction and ensure effective allocation. In addition, GIS fosters sustainability of resilience programs through allowing integration of a wide range of disaster management initiatives based on historical information plus future trends obtained from the analysis: thus communities can adopt more structural resilient systems and land use practices aimed at curbing vulnerability to similar disasters in future years.


## Risk Assessment and Hazard Mapping
The first step to managing a natural disaster is the assessment of risks that are likely to be faced. Geographic Information System (GIS) forms hazard maps by compiling data from different sources including topography, land use, population distribution and historical disaster records; hence it plays a significant role in this field. The maps aid in pinpointing high-risk areas and demographics, enabling the concerned authorities to come up with specific preemptive measures as well as strategies for reducing the impact of disasters. For example, flood risk models based on GIS can estimate probable zones that would be water logged under varying situations which in turn helps in guiding decisions related to urban planning and infrastructure development.


## Real-time Monitoring and Emergency Response
Following a disaster, GIS is used to identify the extent of damage and plan for recovery. The spatial analysis of pre- and post-disaster images helps to quantify impacts on infrastructure, housing and even environmental resources which in turn help inform efforts during reconstruction and resource allocation where such data leads at prioritizing them. Additionally, as a tool for establishing comprehensive disaster management frameworks, GIS contributes to enhancing resilience in the long term. Through historical event analysis juxtaposed with future projections at community level use of GIS aids in coming up with an infrastructure resilient design — based on prudent land-use policies developed to low vulnerability — towards future disasters that can be implemented to ensure a reduced impact on future disasters.

## Post-disaster Recovery and Resilience Building
When disaster strikes, GIS comes into play in assessing the damages and planning on how to recover from them. An interesting approach to take while quantifying effects of disasters on the various aspects such as infrastructure, housing and natural resources is through carrying out a spatial analysis using pre- and post-disaster imageries. This guides the resource allocation prioritization thus influencing the reconstruction programs that are put in place later. Additionally, GIS fosters long-term resilience building by allowing for a comprehensive disaster management plan to be developed based on an analysis of past events and future projections — which then informs appropriate design of resilient infrastructure plus implementation of good land-use policies aimed at reducing vulnerability to future disasters.
